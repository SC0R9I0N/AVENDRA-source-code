The included code is the proposed code implementation described within the paper "AVENDRA: A Conceptual Framework" for the purpose of drone routing.


TODO:
- Update the code to include the graph traversal class - semi functional. Is not properly drawing the path on the graph.
- Add an automatic key to the graph
- Increase robust checks so that it handles all possible Lon/Lat values
- Comment, comment, comment
- Write documentation
- Done
